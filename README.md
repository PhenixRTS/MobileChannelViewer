## Deep links
The app is usable only through a deep link. This can be generated in the Web Control Center customer portal under the EdgeAuth tab by selecting "Viewing". The link will appear under "Web Permalink". Alternatively, a viewing token can be generated using the EdgeAuth SDK and inserted into the example link below.
